# Locate!

Locate! is a world cities location game, implemented as a web application, in which the player locates a given sequence of 10 cities on a world map as accurately as possible. The distance between the clicked location and the real location of the city serves as the scoreâ€”the lower the score, the better.
Users who register for an account can log their scores in the leaderboard and access a personalised stats page.

The application is written in Python using the Flask framework with the help of a PostgreSQL database. The front end is built in HTML, CSS and JavaScript (jQuery) using the Bootstrap and DataTables libraries and the Jinja template engine. The game logic is implemented in JavaScript using the [HERE Maps API](https://developer.here.com/develop/javascript-api).

Locate! was created as a final project for Harvard University's [CS50x](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x) Introduction to Computer Science online course.
